            <h2>Critique</h2>
            <p> Downloading and uploading the CSV file itself was easier than I expected. I hadn’t worked with a raw CSV file in a while, but once it was downloaded and uploaded to Tableau it was simple. One of the most helpful features was how Tableau automatically categorized fields as dimensions or measures. That organization made it much easier to start building visualizations. I didn’t have to manually clean much data, but I did spend time reorganizing how I wanted the categories grouped for clearer comparisons.
In my visualization, I focused primarily on profit as the key metric. I compared profit across different genres, years, movie titles, and studios to see what patterns would emerge. I experimented with filters like selecting the Top 10 and Top 20 films by profit, which made it easier to identify major standouts. I also used color filters to differentiate between genres and specific movies. The color attribute helped visually separate categories.
Looking back, I wish I had chosen a dataset that included geographic data. It would have been interesting to map where certain genres or movies performed best. 
Based on my general understanding of the film industry (and honestly just personal experience watching movies), I expected to see high profits in blockbuster genres like action, fantasy, and animated films.One pattern that confirmed my expectations was the rise in comedy films around 2008–2010. When I filtered by year and genre, I noticed that comedy movies were particularly strong during that time period. That was interesting to see because many of my favorite comedy movies are from that era. It felt validating to see that reflected in the data.
Focusing on that section of the graph, it showed a noticeable clustering of higher-profit comedy films during those years, suggesting that audience demand for that genre was especially high.
One major surprise was the profitability of the movie Fireproof. I had never heard of it before, yet it showed profit levels that were nearly triple that of High School Musical 3, which is a film I would have assumed to be more dominant. This stood out as a clear outlier. I expected a Disney franchise film like High School Musical 3 to outperform an unknown movie to me. Seeing that made me realize that cultural popularity and profitability are not always the same thing.
The outlier made me think to question: was Fireproof produced with an extremely low budget, increasing its profit ratio?
Overall, Tableau Public was very easy to use. I really appreciated how it automatically categorized fields and allowed me to drag and drop dimensions and measures without complex setup. The ability to quickly apply filters (like Top 10 or Top 20) and experiment with color coding made exploring the data much more user-friendly. It also has tons of  design customization options which are all easy to use. I would absolutely recommend Tableau to other students creating graphs!
