            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>For this lab, I explored two AI tools, Google Gemini and Adobe Firefly (Nano Banana). I specifically tested Gemini by uploading my resume and Firefly by attempting to create a visual campaign concept for Olipop Cream Soda. Overall, both tools were useful in limited ways, but neither felt reliable enough to fully depend on without strong human oversight.</p>

            <h2>Tool 1: Google Gemini </h2>
            <h3>Capabilities</h3>
            <p>I first used Google Gemini to rewrite my resume. My original resume (shown in the uploaded image) accurately reflects my experience and skills, even if the language is more straightforward. My prompt was to “edit my resume to take out all high school content and make it strong for applying to a music business job.” When Gemini generated a revised version, the tone sounded more polished and industry-focused. At a glance, it looked impressive and professional.
However, once I actually read through it, I noticed major issues. Gemini added skills and responsibilities that I do not have, such as advanced metadata optimization and release strategy expertise. These were not present in my original resume and went far beyond my real experience. The revised version didn’t sound like me and felt exaggerated, which could be problematic in a real professional setting.</p>

            <h3>Appropriate Use</h3>
            <p>This lab showed me that while Gemini is helpful for improving structure and wording, it cannot be trusted to accurately represent personal experience without very strict limitations. After this lab, I think Gemini is best used for editing and refining content you already know is accurate, rather than generating new descriptions of skills or experience. Without the user paying close attention to detail, using Gemini in this way could be very problematic in a professional setting.</p>

            <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
            <p>Gemini’s resume output highlights how AI can unintentionally exaggerate or misrepresent someone’s qualifications. Even when the intent is to help, the tool may cross ethical boundaries by adding experience the user does not have. Because of this, responsibility falls heavily on the user to carefully review and correct AI-generated content before using it in any professional context.</p>

            <h2>Tool 2: Adobe Firefly (Nano Banana)</h2>
            <!-- Same structure as Tool 1 -->
             <h3>Capabilities</h3>
             <p>I also explored Adobe Firefly (Nano Banana) by trying to create an Olipop Cream Soda campaign image. I included multiple images from this process to show how my prompts evolved over time. My original goal was to create a canned Olipop Cream Soda literally floating in an old-fashioned diner, not a soda float or milkshake.
Firefly consistently misunderstood the word “float” and interpreted it as a soda float rather than a can floating in space. Even after I clarified “canned soda” and added “no shake on the counter,” the tool continued to generate milkshakes or glasses instead of a floating can. While the visuals themselves were appealing, they didn’t follow my instructions closely enough and lacked the precision needed for an actual brand campaign.</p>
           <figure>
            <img src="images/fireflyolipop.png" alt="First AI-generated image from Adobe Firefly" style="max-width:400px; height:auto;">
           </figure>
            <h3>Appropriate Use</h3>
            <p>I could see Firefly being useful if I were pitching a campaign vibe or aesthetic rather than a finished execution. If I wanted to show a client or creative team the general mood of a retro diner–inspired Olipop campaign, Nano Banana could work as a pitch tool. However, it’s not something I could fully rely on for final visuals or exact brand representation.</p>
            <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
            <p>Firefly raises ethical questions related to transparency and accuracy. Because the images appear realistic, they could be misleading if presented as real photography or used without clear context. While Adobe attempts to address these concerns, responsibility ultimately falls on the user to evaluate and appropriately use the generated visuals.</p>

            <h2>Broader Reflections</h2>
            <p>Personally, I see myself using AI tools as support tools in my everyday life rather than relying on them for major academic or work-related projects. They are especially helpful for brainstorming ideas, organizing thoughts, and exploring creative directions when I feel stuck or overwhelmed. AI can be useful at the beginning of a process, helping me get ideas flowing or see different possibilities, but I don’t think it should be responsible for final decisions or finished work. Those choices need to come from me, since I understand my goals, values, and voice better than a tool ever could. Using AI this way feels more responsible and realistic, especially in settings where accuracy and authenticity matter.</p>
            <p>In the DCDA program, AI tools will likely continue to influence how technical skills are applied, especially in areas like content creation, data organization, and basic analysis. These tools may speed up certain processes and make experimentation more accessible, which can be helpful for learning. However, they also make skills like critical thinking, creativity, and ethical judgment even more important. Understanding why decisions are made, how data is interpreted, and how digital content affects real audiences are things AI cannot fully replicate. Human judgment, cultural awareness, and originality remain essential in digital culture and data analytics work. While AI can assist with efficiency, the ability to think critically, make ethical choices, and tell meaningful stories will continue to be uniquely human skills that the DCDA program emphasizes.</p>
