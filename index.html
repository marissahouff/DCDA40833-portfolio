            <!-- TODO: After completing all labs, write a reflection on your growth -->
            <p>Both VS Code and GitHub were completely new to me before starting these labs, but overall I felt really good about the experience because there was so much guidance throughout. Lab 1 especially set me up for success and made it easy to understand what I was doing step by step. I really enjoyed being able to personalize the site and make it feel like it actually reflects me, my interests, and my goals. The biggest challenge for me was figuring out where my content needed to go and which files controlled what, but as I worked through it, navigating between the index and styles files became much easier. I feel a lot more confident using VS Code now, and GitHub feels simple and effective rather than intimidating. Overall, my understanding of digital tools and how they work together has grown, and I feel excited and prepared to build on these skills in future labs and projects.</p>
